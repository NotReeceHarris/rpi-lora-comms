#    this is an UART-LoRa device and thers is an firmware on Module
#    users can transfer or receive the data directly by UART and dont
#    need to set parameters like coderate,spread factor,etc.
#    |============================================ |
#    |   It does not suport LoRaWAN protocol !!!   |

#    This script is mainly for Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4B, and Zero series
#    Since PC/Laptop does not have GPIO to control HAT, it should be configured by
#    GUI and while setting the jumpers, 
#    Please refer to another script pc_main.py

#    Need to disable the serial login shell and have to enable serial interface 
#    command `sudo raspi-config`
#    More details: see https://github.com/MithunHub/LoRa/blob/main/Basic%20Instruction.md
#
#    When the LoRaHAT is attached to RPi, the M0 and M1 jumpers of HAT should be removed.

#   serial_num
#       PiZero, Pi3B+, and Pi4B use "/dev/ttyS0"
#
#    Frequency is [850 to 930], or [410 to 493] MHz
#
#    address is 0 to 65535
#        under the same frequence,if set 65535,the node can receive 
#        messages from another node of address is 0 to 65534 and similarly,
#        the address 0 to 65534 of node can receive messages while 
#        the another note of address is 65535 sends.
#        otherwise two node must be same the address and frequence
#
#    The tramsmit power is {10, 13, 17, and 22} dBm
#
#    RSSI (receive signal strength indicator) is {True or False}
#        It will print the RSSI value when it receives each message
